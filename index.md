### Fifty years of domain theory

Fifty years ago, [Dana Scott](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scott/)
introduced domain theory for the purposes of denotational semantics of
programming languages when he was in Oxford, where he worked with
Christopher Strachey. This work has had a vast and lasting impact on
logic, computer science, and mathematics. As part of the Workshop
DOMAINS'2018, which will take place in Oxford on 8–9 July 2018, we
will celebrate 50 years of domain theory and Dana Scott's 85th
birthday. The event is affiliated with the [Federated Logic Conference
2018](http://www.floc2018.org).

### About the DOMAINS workshop series

The applications of domain theory include programming logics (LCF), design of programming
languages, models of the lambda calculus, applications to recursion theory (higher-type
computability, Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology (injective spaces,
function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone duality), topological algebra (Lawson
semilattices) and analysis (measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover, these
applications are related – for example, Stone duality has given rise to a logic of
observable properties of computational processes.

The Domains workshop series is aimed at computer scientists and mathematicians alike who
share an interest in the mathematical foundations of computation. The workshop series
focuses on domains, their applications in mathematics and computer science, and related
topics. Previous meetings were held in Darmstadt (1994, 1999, 2004), Braunschweig (1996),
Munich (1997), Siegen (1998), Birmingham (2002), Novosibirsk (2007), Brighton (2008),
Swansea (2011), Paris (2014), and Cork (2015).

#### Organization

The event is organized by [Andrej Bauer](http://www.andrej.com/) and [Martín Escardó](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/).

Further details about the Program committee and the format of the meeting will be
published here in due time.
