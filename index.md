Fifty years ago, [Dana Scott](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scott/)
introduced domain theory for the purposes of denotational semantics of
programming languages when he was in Oxford, where he worked with
Christopher Strachey. This work has had a vast and lasting impact on
logic, computer science, and mathematics. As part of the Workshop
DOMAINS'2018, which will take place in Oxford on 7–8 July 2018, we
will celebrate 50 years of domain theory and Dana Scott's 85th
birthday. The event is affiliated with the [Federated Logic Conference
2018](http://www.floc2018.org).

### About the DOMAINS workshop series

The applications of domain theory include programming logics (LCF), design of programming
languages, models of the lambda calculus, applications to recursion theory (higher-type
computability, Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology (injective spaces,
function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone duality), topological algebra (Lawson
semilattices) and analysis (measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover, these
applications are related – for example, Stone duality has given rise to a logic of
observable properties of computational processes.

Topics of interaction with domain theory for this workshop include, but are not limited
to: program semantics, program logics, probabilistic computation, exact computation over
the real numbers, lambda calculus, games, models of sequential computation, constructive
mathematics, recursion theory, realizability, real analysis and computability, topology,
metric spaces and domains, idempotent analysis and domains, locale theory, category
theory, topos theory, type theory.

The Domains workshop series is aimed at computer scientists and mathematicians alike who
share an interest in the mathematical foundations of computation. The workshop series
focuses on domains, their applications in mathematics and computer science, and related
topics. Previous meetings were held in Darmstadt (1994, 1999, 2004), Braunschweig (1996),
Munich (1997), Siegen (1998), Birmingham (2002), Novosibirsk (2007), Brighton (2008),
Swansea (2011), Paris (2014), and Cork (2015).
