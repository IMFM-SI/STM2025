Fifty years ago, [Dana Scott](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scott/) introduced domain theory for
the purposes of denotational semantics of programming languages when he was in Oxford,
where he worked with Christopher Strachey. This work has had a vast and lasting impact on
logic, computer science, and mathematics. As part of the Workshop DOMAINS'2018, which will
take place in Oxford on 7–8 July 2018, we will celebrate 50 years of domain theory and
Dana Scott's 85th birthday. We will also commemorate Klaus Keimel, the founder of the
workshop series.

The event is affiliated with
the [Federated Logic Conference 2018](http://www.floc2018.org).

##### A statement about the arrest of Abbas Edalat in Iran

The Organizers and PC members of the workshop are deeply disappointed that our longtime
colleague Abbas Edalat is currently under arrest in Iran and is therefore unable to attend
the meeting and present a paper he and a colleague submitted for the workshop. As far as
we know, no formal charges have been lodged against Professor Edalat, and no trial date
has been set. We are concerned for the health and well being of our colleague. We also are
mystified why a native Iranian who has devoted so much his time and energy to opening
communication between the academic community in Iran and those in the west, and who
founded CASMII, the campaign against sanctions and military intervention in Iran, has been
imprisoned. We urge all those in positions to intervene on his behalf to make every effort
to have him freed as soon as possible.

More information can be found at [Abbas Edalat's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_Edalat) and at the [Communications
of the ACM web page](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/articles/228407-our-concerns-about-the-arrest-of-abbas-edalat-in-iran/fulltext).

#### Organization

The event is organized by [Andrej Bauer](http://www.andrej.com/) and [Martín Escardó](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/).

### About the DOMAINS workshop series

The applications of domain theory include programming logics (LCF), design of programming
languages, models of the lambda calculus, applications to recursion theory (higher-type
computability, Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals), general topology (injective spaces,
function spaces, locally compact spaces, Stone duality), topological algebra (Lawson
semilattices) and analysis (measure, integration, dynamical systems). Moreover, these
applications are related – for example, Stone duality has given rise to a logic of
observable properties of computational processes.

Topics of interaction with domain theory for this workshop include, but are not limited
to: program semantics, program logics, probabilistic computation, exact computation over
the real numbers, lambda calculus, games, models of sequential computation, constructive
mathematics, recursion theory, realizability, real analysis and computability, topology,
metric spaces and domains, idempotent analysis and domains, locale theory, category
theory, topos theory, type theory.

The Domains workshop series is aimed at computer scientists and mathematicians alike who
share an interest in the mathematical foundations of computation. The workshop series
focuses on domains, their applications in mathematics and computer science, and related
topics. Previous meetings were held in Darmstadt (1994, 1999, 2004), Braunschweig (1996),
Munich (1997), Siegen (1998), Birmingham (2002), Novosibirsk (2007), Brighton (2008),
Swansea (2011), Paris (2014), and Cork (2015).
